## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

API created to communicate with MongoDB collection that stores a movie's name, if it has been watched, and the times watched. Basic operations of Get, Post, Put, and Delete. 

## Optimizations

Need to build some additional Get requests to help handle some additional features down the road, such as top 5 most watched movies, and least watched movies. 

## Lessons Learned:

Originally set this project up using PostgreSQL, but opted for MongoDB due to the cloud-based structure. Learned how to convert my query statements to MongoDB methods, and really enjoyed the ease of use with MongoDB and it's related products.
